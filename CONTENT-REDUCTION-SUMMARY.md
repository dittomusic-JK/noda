- Explanatory language
- Softer, academic tone

**After:**
- Punchy, declarative statements
- Sentence fragments for impact
- Military-style brevity
- Period-separated phrases

- ❌ "Coordinate autonomous swarms across air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains with distributed decision-making"
- ✅ "Coordinate autonomous swarms across all domains. Distributed decision-making."

- ❌ "From NASA, MIT, DARPA, and GTRI. Patriots focused on defense innovation."
- ✅ "NASA. MIT. DARPA. GTRI. Patriots building for patriots."

### Visual/Layout Changes

1. **Hero Section:**
   - Left-aligned (was center-aligned)
   - CTAs left-aligned

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Visual inspection at 1920px width
- [ ] Visual inspection at 1440px width
- [ ] Visual inspection at mobile (375px)
- [ ] Verify left-alignment looks intentional
- [ ] Check that reduced copy maintains clarity
- [ ] Verify all animations still trigger correctly

## Before/After Comparison

### Hero Headline
```
BEFORE:
Building the Best
Chess Player
Not the Chess Pieces

AFTER:
The Best Chess Player
Not Chess Pieces
```

### Capabilities
```

Coordinate autonomous swarms across air, land, sea, space, 
and cyber domains with distributed decision-making and 
real-time adaptation.

AFTER:
Coordinate autonomous swarms across all domains. 
Distributed decision-making. Real-time adaptation.
```

### Statement
```
BEFORE:
Autonomous systems should coordinate like tactical teams,
not operate as isolated platforms.

AFTER:
COORDINATE LIKE TEAMS,
NOT ISOLATED PLATFORMS
```

## Next Steps

### Additional Opportunities for Reduction

1. **About Page** - Could reduce mission statement copy
2. **Use Case Pages** - Reduce technical specifications, increase visual prominence
3. **Solutions Page** - Simplify feature lists
4. **Trust Indicators Section** - Could condense descriptions

### Image-First Layouts (Next Priority)

Per DESIGN-MIGRATION.md recommendations:
1. Source high-quality defense imagery
2. Create full-screen image sections with minimal text overlays
3. Add parallax effects to large images
4. Implement Gambit-style progressive disclosure

### Copy Style Guide

For future content, follow these patterns:
- **Sentence length:** 3-8 words maximum
- **Punctuation:** Use periods to separate short declaratives
- **Connectors:** Eliminate "and", "with", "that", "for" where possible
- **Style:** Military brief, not marketing copy
- **Tone:** Declarative, not persuasive

---

**Status:** Content reduction complete ✅  
**Next:** Source high-quality imagery and implement image-first layouts
